The series below gives you the intuition instead of the techniques for linear algebra

## Key points
1. It's possible to represent different coordinate systems with basis vectors
2. If the basis vectors are linearly independent then it's possible to specify any vector in dimensional space(2D,3D,etc), if they are dependent then the set of vectors will be restricted (e.g. for a 2-D space, the basis vectors of [1,1] and [-1,-1] can only have vectors within the line that join those two vectors ) 
3. Think about transformation of matrices as transformation of the space ( evenly spaced and centered at origin ) 
4. Computation uses - solving linear equations 
    Useful terms 
    - identity matrix ( a matrix that doesn't change anything )
    - inverse matrix undoes it's matrix
    ```
    A*v = r
    v = (inverse of A) * r  
    ```
